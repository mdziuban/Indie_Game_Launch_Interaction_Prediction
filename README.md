# Indie_Game_Launch_Interaction_Prediction

#### Description

This was my second project for the METIS data science bootcamp.  

In this project, I assumed the role of a marketing data scientist for an indie game company.  I created a model to help drive sales of a newly launched game by creating a targeted prediction of user interaction to reach 20k sales.  

When launching a game on a platform such as Steam or Itch.io there are many hurdles to jump and the competition is extremely flooded. Making your game stand out is an important part of a game launch and should be started a significant amount of time ahead of the launch to increase visibiility and awareness. Making sure you have a solid game is only part of the complete puzzle.

Another part of a successful launch is ensuring that your comsumers are engaged with the game and are invested in it on an emotional level. Setting goals of interactions to ensure the engagement level is on track will help to determine what is working and not working when it comes to engagement strategies.

This project is focused on determining where the game engagement level should be within 1 to 2 years from launch.

I used data from Steam and also scraped data to find top game companies for a point of reference.

Linear Regression was used to build the prediction model.
